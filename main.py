"""
main.py — FastAPI webhook server and orchestration layer for DevWhisper.

This module is the central entry point for the DevWhisper voice agent.
It exposes REST endpoints that receive webhooks from Vapi (voice platform),
orchestrates the retrieval + LLM pipeline, manages per-session conversation
memory, and provides admin/monitoring utilities.

Endpoints:
    POST /          — Health/root check (prevents 502 from load balancers).
    POST /webhook   — Main Vapi webhook handler (assistant-request, function-call, tool-calls).
    GET  /health    — Liveness probe.
    GET  /statistics— Repository and indexing statistics.
    POST /reset     — Clear all conversation history.
    POST /stream    — Streaming query endpoint (SSE-style text/plain).
    GET  /admin/sessions — List active conversation sessions (admin only).
    POST /index/start    — Trigger background indexing.
    GET  /index/progress — SSE stream of indexing progress.
    GET  /index/summary  — Latest repository scan summary (issue #224).
    GET  /history        — Retrieve conversation history.

Architecture:
    Vapi (voice) → FastAPI (/webhook) → Retriever (hybrid search) →
    LLM (Groq) → FastAPI response → Vapi (TTS)

Cache lifecycle:
    Answers are cached per repository in cache.py. The background indexing
    worker drops a repository's cached answers once a job has touched its
    index, so a re-index is immediately visible to callers instead of being
    masked by pre-re-index answers. Dry runs change nothing and are exempt.

Security:
    Admin endpoints are protected by an X-Admin-Secret header and fail
    closed (401) if ADMIN_SECRET is not configured.

    Drop everything this process is holding about *repo_id*'s old index.

    Called when an indexing job has touched the index, so the next question
    is answered from the code that is on disk now rather than from the
    snapshot that was indexed before.

    Two caches sit in front of retrieval:

      - The response cache in ``cache.py``. This is the one that actually
        hurts. Its entries are whole answers, complete with the
        "Sources used:" footer, and they survive until 50 other distinct
        queries evict them. After a re-index that renamed or deleted files,
        that footer cites paths the repository no longer contains — which is
        worse than a stale answer, because the citation makes it look
        verified. Near-duplicate matching makes it stickier still: any
        rephrasing within ``CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`` hits the same entry.

      - The BM25 payload cached in ``retriever.py``. That one already
        self-heals through its (mtime, size) stamp, so this call only makes
        the reload immediate instead of waiting for the next stat().

    Neither failure is worth taking the worker thread down for, so both are
    contained.
